# Bayesian Additive Regression Trees for Multivariate skewed responses

This repository contains code to implement the methodology described in the paper "Bayesian Additive Regression Trees for Multivariate Skewed Responses", by Um et al (2022+).

This package uses the primary functions from [`SoftBART`](https://github.com/theodds/SoftBART) to incorporate the SoftBART model as a component.

## Installation

The packages can be installed with the `devtools` package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools) 
devtools::install_github(repo='Seungha-Um/skewBART') 
# or 
devtools::install_github(repo='Seungha-Um/skewBART',build_vignettes = TRUE) 
```
